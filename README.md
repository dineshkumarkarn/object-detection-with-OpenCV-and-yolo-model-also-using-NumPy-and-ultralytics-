# object-detection-with-OpenCV-and-yolo-model-also-using-NumPy-and-ultralytics-
In this project i use ultralytics  for trai the modelume 
opencv for take the video or chemara input using webcam, 
yolo model which we trained using utralytics for detect the object
numpy for the seeds and the calculation in this project
